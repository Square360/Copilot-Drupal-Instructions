# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This directory contains GitHub Copilot instruction files for this Drupal project.

> **ðŸ’¡ Entry Point**: The main entry point for Copilot is at `../.github/copilot-instructions.md` which provides an overview and links to all files in this directory.

## Quick Start

These instruction files provide context-aware assistance for:

- **Drupal 10/11 development** with Square360 standards
- **Pantheon hosting** specific patterns and workflows
- **Accessibility, security, and performance** best practices
- **Module development** and theming guidelines

## Files in This Directory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `instructions.md` | Core Copilot instructions and coding standards |
| `overview.md` | Project overview template and development context |
| `drupal-modules.md` | Module development patterns and examples |
| `themes-frontend.md` | Theme development and frontend guidelines |
| `accessibility.md` | WCAG compliance and accessibility standards |
| `security-performance.md` | Security practices and performance optimization |
| `session-checklist.md` | Development session workflow and quality checks |
| `copilot.local.md.example` | Template for personal developer instructions |

## Customization

### Team Instructions (Shared)

**Important**: The main instruction files are automatically updated when the package is updated to ensure you get the latest Square360 standards and Drupal best practices. For project-specific customizations:

- Make changes after package updates
- Consider proposing improvements back to the package repository
- Document project-specific deviations in your project README

**Files that get updated automatically:**
- `instructions.md`, `overview.md`, `drupal-modules.md`, `themes-frontend.md`
- `accessibility.md`, `security-performance.md`, `session-checklist.md`

**Files that are protected from updates:**
- `README.md` (this file - project-specific documentation)
- `copilot.local.md` (personal instructions)
- `CHANGELOG-COPILOT.md` (at project root)

### Personal Instructions (Private)
Create personal instructions that won't be committed:

```bash
cp copilot.local.md.example copilot.local.md
# Edit copilot.local.md with your personal preferences
```

Your `copilot.local.md` file is automatically git-ignored and will contain your personal development preferences.

## Auto-Customization

The package includes an auto-customization feature. Run this prompt with Copilot to automatically customize the instructions for your project:

2. **Customize Instructions**: Update the instruction files with:
   - Replace "[Project Name]" placeholders with actual project name
   - Add specific custom modules and themes to examples
   - Include project-specific coding patterns
   - Update file paths and URLs to match the project structure

3. **Create Project Changelog**: Set up `CHANGELOG-COPILOT.md` at the project root with:
   - Proper project name and description
   - Template ready for tracking development activities

Please analyze the codebase and customize all relevant instruction files to provide the most helpful context for this specific project.
